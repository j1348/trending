# Trending

the Trending project is an attempt to provide a GraphQL server in to query last Github trends.

## Motivation

There are a couple of alternatives but none offer the features I wanted.

- Quick overview of last trends sorted by differentes languages
- Automatic sort by the average of stars by day

## Future plan

Add the capability to pin a project for future scan (plan for the future)
